Documentation
- [x] docstrings
- [] comments explaining threading stuff
- [] clean up log msgs

Refactoring

- [] DRY out the df consolidation code
- [] handle errors in json responses

Performance
- [] consider the 100-first approach of the downloads

Testing

- [] test prices

MVP
- what is minimum amount of work we need to do to feel like we can publish this to github and let others look at it?
